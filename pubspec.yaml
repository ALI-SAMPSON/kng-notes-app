flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/fonts/

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Nunito
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Nunito-Black.ttf
          weight: 900
        - asset: assets/fonts/Nunito-ExtraBold.ttf
          weight: 800
        - asset: assets/fonts/Nunito-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/Nunito-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: assets/fonts/Nunito-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/Nunito-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/Nunito-Light.ttf
          weight: 300
